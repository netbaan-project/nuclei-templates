    This template is designed to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities with a specific payload.

        dsl:
          - 'method == "GET"'  # Run only on GET requests

    payloads:

        words:
          - "error"            # Look for a typical error message that indicates a SQL injection issue
          - "SQL syntax"       # Another common SQL error message indicating a SQL injection
          - "{{sqli}}"         # Match the payload directly in the response

        status:
          - 500                # Common status code for server errors that may arise from SQL injection
          - 400                # Bad request, which can also indicate a SQL injection issue
          - 200                # Sometimes, a 200 response with an SQL injection could indicate a successful exploit
